As an otorhinolaryngologist-head & neck surgeon-in-training, I am constantly honing my skills and experience in the managing of patients with ear, nose and throat conditions, and carrying out a wide range of ENT surgery care in the clinic, ward and operating theatres under the guidance and mentorship of my clinical teachers.   

Besides clinical practice, my current research interests are on the application of large language models in healthcare and head and neck cancers. I also have a keen interests in the basic and translational cancer research including cancer metabolism and the tumour microenvironment.
